/*** 
 * This is my 2016 implementation of the BIDE+ algorithm. I have re-implemented this algorithm in SPMF 0.99
 * with better design decisions and optimizations than in the previous implementation offered in SPMF, which
 * had been implemented a few years ago. This new implementation can be up to 10 times faster than the previous 
 * implementation. 
 * 
 * If you want to understand the BIDE+ algorithm, I highly recommend to first read the paper very carefully as it
 * is a quite complex algorithm, and it would thus be quite difficult to understand the code without reading the paper
 * to first understand the key ideas of BIDE+.
 * 
 * The BIDE+ algorithm was proposed by Pei et al. 2001.
 * 
 * NOTE: This implementation saves the pattern  to a file as soon 
 * as they are found or can keep the pattern into memory, depending
 * on what the user choose.
